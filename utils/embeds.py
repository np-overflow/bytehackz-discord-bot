            You've got yourself a cool prototype in mind, and as your Team is setting things up, you realize something.\n\n\
            Maybe its the fact that the services you're planning to use are incompaitable, or that Python 2.9 just won't cut it.\n\n\
            That's where the Techies over at the **Genius Bar** come into play!\n\n\
            These guys here have great experience and can offer valuable feedback and suggestions on how you can get your prototype up and running\n\n\n\
